# apollua

This is an implementation of Lua 5.1 in C#.  At the time I wrote it, there was
no pure-C# implementation of Lua (especially not one using an interpreter
rather than dynamic compliation, which was all the rage at the time - see
IronPython).

I was looking for an implementation of Lua which would run on the Xbox 360's
C# virtual machine (i.e. XNA/XBLIG), which did not support Reflection.Emit.
Hence this project.

I haven't looked at this for a long time now, and I make no promises of
utility.  But who knows - maybe someone will find it helpful!
